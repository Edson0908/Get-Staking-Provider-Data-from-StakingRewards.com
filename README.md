# Historical Staking Provider Data Web App using StakingRewards.com

This is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to fetch historical data for various staking providers (validators) on StakingRewards.com. It uses the Staking Rewards  API to fetch data for multiple assets at a time.

The app allows the user to enter the slug of the staking provider they want historical data for, the metrics of the staking provider they want historical data for, and the date range they are looking for. When inputting multiple staking providers, the user can separate them by a comma without a space.

The app then fetches the historical data for each asset using the Staking Rewards API and displays it in a table. The user can also download the data in CSV format.

This app is useful for users who want to analyze the historical staking data of various staking providers and make informed decisions about their investments.
